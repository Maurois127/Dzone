## Welcome to Dzone!!
Maurois Juza S. Maravilla. 2006-present

I'll use this website as my coping zone, where I can go to when I want to reminisce. 
### DZONE

I want this website to be beneficial to you and me. You and I might have something in common. Check it out 

## A little info about my name lol

### Maurois
It's pronounced as "Maura". I got my first name from a French author, Andre Maurois. I don't know why my parents named me after him but I like it anyway.  

### Juza
I never knew why my second name is Juza. I asked my parents about it and the answer I got was "We'll tell you when you turn 18". I feel kind of exited to turn 18.

## Apple of my eye
I love funny pictures of animals. They make my heart flutter and I go soft.

### Here, I want to put pictures of the things that gives me comfort.
